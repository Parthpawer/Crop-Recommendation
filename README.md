# Crop Recommendation System

Welcome to the Crop Recommendation System GitHub repository! ðŸŒ±

This project utilizes machine learning to predict the best suitable crop based on environmental factors such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH, temperature, and soil type. The aim of this project is to assist individuals in the farming industry by providing accurate crop recommendations.

## Project Overview

- **Accuracy**: The machine learning model achieves an impressive accuracy of 97%.
- **Data**: Currently trained on data from various districts of Maharashtra.
- **Future Plans**: We plan to expand our dataset to cover all regions of India in the future.
